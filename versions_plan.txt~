v1.0.1 (8): Fix bugs:
    Bug that forces the app to close if launched from the android unlock screen. Fixed 07/03/14.
    Bug that causes list and task names and colours not to update promptly when added or changed.
    Clicking bottom list item crashes app.
v1.0.2 (9): Task views tagged with dates so the date list only needs to be read in from the preferences once.
v1.0.3 (10): Task dates updated in TaskWrapped class when changed on edit task screen.
v1.0.4 (11): Passed dates reset to today if task isn't removed. (Not sure I need this, since I'm judging dates on them being after the current date or not.)
